# Python-Pokemon-Guessing-Game

This is my Pokemon Guessing Game. By only asking questions with "yes" or "no" answers, this program will correctly guess which Pokemon you are thinking of!

The algorithm will repeatedly select the question to ask that will create as close of a 50/50 split as possible of the remaining Pokemon. By utilising this method, 900 potential options can be reduced to 1, on average, within 10 questions.

(*This program is intended for use on Pycharm as that is where it was created.*)

(*This project was built by myself before having a GitHub account, as a result I have no commit history of the development of this project. However I am planning on creating a version in JavaScript that will have a full commit history.*)
